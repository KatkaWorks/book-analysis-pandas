# Book Data - My First DataFrame

This is my very first mini data project using Python and pandas.

## What Iâ€™ve done so far:

- Created a Python dictionary with book information (title, author, year, price, etc.)
- Converted that dictionary into a pandas DataFrame (table)
- Displayed the table in the console

## Tools used:
- Python 
- pandas 
- Thonny (IDE)

## Next steps:
- Learn how to filter and analyze the data
- Practice basic data manipulations (sorting, conditions)
- Add comments and keep improving the script
